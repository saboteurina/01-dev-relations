# Exercise: Liberty Mutual Developer Relations site

First code challenge for the MERN program at LM: a responsive site consisting of a page of content and a survey.

Note: Comprehensive form validation and sending form data to a server weren't part of this exercise. I would work on these next if I continued building this out.
